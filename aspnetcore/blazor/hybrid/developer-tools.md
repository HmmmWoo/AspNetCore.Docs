## .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid

To use developer tools with a .NET MAUI Blazor app, use the guidance in the following sections depending on the operating system used to run the app:

* [iOS](#ios)
* [Android](#android)

### iOS

Use the following steps to use Safari developer tools with an iOS app.

1. Open desktop Safari.
1. Select the **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Show Develop** menu item.
1. Run the .NET MAUI Blazor app in the iOS simulator.
1. Return to desktop Safari. Select **Develop** > **Simulator** > **0.0.0.0**. If multiple entries for **0.0.0.0** are present, select the entry that highlights the `BlazorWebView`. The `BlazorWebView` is highlighted in blue in the iOS simulator when the correct **0.0.0.0** entry is selected.

1. The **Web Inspector** window appears for the `BlazorWebView`.
1. Developer tools provide a variety of features for working with apps, including which assets the page requested, how long assets took to load, and the content of loaded assets. The following example shows the **Console** tab, which includes any exception messages generated by the framework or developer code:

1. Open Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
1. Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#devices` (Google Chrome) or `edge://inspect/#devices` (Microsoft Edge).
1. Select the **`inspect`** link button to open developer tools. The following example shows the **DevTools** page in Microsoft Edge:
